java 8:-Features 

 benefit's:- 1)it reduce the code
            2)it use for functional  programing benefit's
            3)to enable the parallel programing enable multicore code with multi core processor 
      

Default method:- the methods that are with body is called Default
                - we can directly use without overriding them

Static methods:- the method that are declared inside the interface with static keyword or declared with the abstract keyword 
  - it contain the complete definition of function because it cannot override
  - we can declared the main method inside the interface in java 8 version  


1)Functional Interface :- the interface   that conation only one abstract  methos is called is Function Interface but it can have any number of default and static method
                         - by using this we can achieve lambda expression


what is advantage of @FuntionalInterface Annotation
-it restrict the interface to be Functional Interface
-if any one after using lambda expression can add any abstract method in interface it give error
