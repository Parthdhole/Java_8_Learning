1)Functional Interface :- the function that conation only one abstract  methos is called is Function Interface 
                          by using this we can achieve lambda expression 
                   
                         
2)Lambada Expression :- the expression without return type, without access modifier and without method name 
by using Lambada Expression we can write implementation of Functional Interface 

-- it also  use to reduce boiler plate code
-by using this we can implement method logic without creating object


Java is object-oriented but not fully object-oriented because it supports primitive data types, static methods, and static variables that can be accessed without creating objects. Additionally, from Java 8 onwards, interfaces can have static and default method implementations, which can be executed without object creation. These features violate pure object-oriented principles.
